# <a name="manage-move-collections-and-resource-groups"></a>Gestire le raccolte di spostamento e i gruppi di risorse

Questo articolo descrive come rimuovere risorse da una raccolta di spostamento o rimuovere una raccolta/gruppo di risorse di spostamento in [Azure Resource Mover](overview.md). Le raccolte di spostamento vengono usate quando si spostano le risorse di Azure tra aree di Azure.

## <a name="remove-a-resource-portal"></a>Rimuovere una risorsa (portale)

È possibile rimuovere le risorse in una raccolta di spostamento, nel portale di Resource Mover, come indicato di seguito:

1. In **aree diverse** selezionare tutte le risorse che si desidera rimuovere dalla raccolta e selezionare **Rimuovi**. 

    ![Pulsante da rimuovere](./media/remove-move-resources/portal-select-resources.png)

2. In **Rimuovi risorse** fare clic su **Rimuovi**.

## <a name="remove-a-move-collectionresource-group-portal"></a>Rimuovere una raccolta o un gruppo di risorse di spostamento (portale)

È possibile rimuovere una raccolta o un gruppo di risorse di spostamento nel portale.

1. Per rimuovere le risorse dalla raccolta, seguire le istruzioni riportate nella procedura precedente. Se si sta rimuovendo un gruppo di risorse, assicurarsi che non contenga risorse.
2. Eliminare la raccolta di spostamento o il gruppo di risorse.  

## <a name="remove-a-resource-powershell"></a>Rimuovere una risorsa (PowerShell)

Usando i cmdlet di PowerShell è possibile rimuovere una singola risorsa da un oggetto MoveCollection oppure rimuovere più risorse.

### <a name="remove-a-single-resource"></a>Rimuovere una singola risorsa

Rimuovere una risorsa (in questo esempio la rete virtuale *psdemorm-VNET*) come indicato di seguito:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Remove a resource using the resource ID
Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveResource -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS" -Name "psdemorm-vnet"
```
**Output dopo l'esecuzione del cmdlet**

![Testo di output dopo la rimozione di una risorsa da una raccolta di spostamento](./media/remove-move-resources/powershell-remove-single-resource.png)

### <a name="remove-multiple-resources"></a>Rimuovere più risorse

Rimuovere più risorse come segue:

1. Convalidare le dipendenze:

    ````azurepowershell-interactive
    $resp = Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('psdemorm-vnet') -ValidateOnly
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

    ![Output text after removing multiple resources from a move collection](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-multiple-validate-dependencies.png)

2. Retrieve the dependent resources that need to be removed (along with our example virtual network psdemorm-vnet):

    ````azurepowershell-interactive
    $resp.AdditionalInfo[0].InfoMoveResource
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

    ![Output text after removing multiple resources from a move collection](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-multiple-get-dependencies.png)


3. Remove all resources, along with the virtual network:

    
    ````azurepowershell-interactive
    Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('PSDemoVM','psdemovm111', 'PSDemoRM-vnet','PSDemoVM-nsg')
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

    ![Output text after removing all resources from a move collection](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-multiple-all.png)


## Remove a collection (PowerShell)

Remove an entire move collection from the subscription, as follows:

1. Follow the instructions above to remove resources in the collection using PowerShell.
2. Run:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveCollection -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

## VM resource state after removing

What happens when you remove a VM resource from a move collection depends on the resource state, as summarized in the table.

###  Remove VM state
**Resource state** | **VM** | **Networking**
--- | --- | --- 
**Added to move collection** | Delete from move collection. | Delete from move collection. 
**Dependencies resolved/prepare pending** | Delete from move collection  | Delete from move collection. 
**Prepare in progress**<br/> (or any other state in progress) | Delete operation fails with error.  | Delete operation fails with error.
**Prepare failed** | Delete from the move collection.<br/>Delete anything created in the target region, including replica disks. <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. | Delete from the move collection.  
**Initiate move pending** | Delete from move collection.<br/><br/> Delete anything created in the target region, including VM, replica disks etc.  <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. | Delete from move collection.
**Initiate move failed** | Delete from move collection.<br/><br/> Delete anything created in the target region, including VM, replica disks etc.  <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. | Delete from move collection.
**Commit pending** | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. 
**Commit failed** | We recommend that you discard the  so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there.
**Discard completed** | The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state.<br/><br/> It's deleted from the move collection, along with anything created at target - VM, replica disks, vault etc.  <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. |  The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state.<br/><br/> It's deleted from the move collection.

**Delete source failed** | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region. | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region.

## SQL resource state after removing

What happens when you remove an Azure SQL resource from a move collection depends on the resource state, as summarized in the table.

**Resource state** | **SQL** 
--- | ---

**Dependencies resolved/prepare pending** | Delete from move collection 
**Prepare in progress**<br/> (or any other state in progress)  | Delete operation fails with error. 
**Prepare failed** | Delete from move collection<br/><br/>Delete anything created in the target region. 
**Initiate move pending** |  Delete from move collection<br/><br/>Delete anything created in the target region. The SQL database exists at this point and will be deleted. 
**Initiate move failed** | Delete from move collection<br/><br/>Delete anything created in the target region. The SQL database exists at this point and must be deleted. 
**Commit pending** | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there.
